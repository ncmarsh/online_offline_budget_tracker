## Usage

This application is a budget tracker where the user can input their income and expenses while on the go. No need to worry about losing internet connection, thanks to the app's offline access!

## Roadmap

To further this project, I would like to add filters and categories to make this app more customizable. I would like the user to be able to view by a date range or by income/expense or by the type of transaction. I would also like to explore a budget planner, either a separate page or a separate function, where the user could forecast what their spending may be like. I would also like to add the ability to edit and delete transactions.
